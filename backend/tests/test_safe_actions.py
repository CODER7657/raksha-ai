"""Prompt injection must not reach the advice a user acts on (#113).

The path this closes: a scam message carries injected text, the model complies,
and `recommended_action` — a field an elderly or low-literacy user is told to
follow, and which TTS reads aloud — carries the attacker's instruction.

Two defences, tested separately because they fail differently:

  * **The action is chosen, not written.** The model returns an id from a closed
    set and we supply the wording. An injection becomes an invalid id, which is
    a failure with no victim.
  * **Prose that asks for a credential is refused.** `explanation` stays free
    text because it describes rather than instructs, so it gets the one check
    that matters.

The corpus is `testdata/injection_corpus.jsonl`, shared with the A2 work in #115
§3 because a payload that steers one model steers the other.
