# Punjabi / ਪੰਜਾਬੀ — rule review

Language code `pa` · currently **unreviewed** · 5 rules

You are the reviewer this asks for. Nobody who speaks this language has
read these rules — they were written from a concept list, which makes them
a guess until you say otherwise.

**You do not need to read any code.** Each section gives you the words the
detector currently looks for, and what it is trying to catch. Answer in
the space provided, in whatever form is easiest.

> The question is **not** whether the words are grammatical.
> It is whether they are what a *scammer would actually write* — including
> misspellings, English words mixed in, and transliteration, if that is how
> these messages really arrive.

## Part 2 — real scam messages

Six to ten if you can. These do two jobs: they become test cases proving
the rules fire, and they seed the pattern database the AI compares
against — which for this language is currently **empty**, so verdicts here
are the model guessing unaided.

Best are messages you or someone you know actually received. Invented ones
are still far better than nothing, as long as they are how these really
sound.

**Please remove real phone numbers, links and account numbers** — replace
with `XXXXX`. Nothing here should identify anyone.

Spread them across these if you can: OTP request · KYC expiry · account
lock · lottery win · refund link · urgent verification.

| # | The message, as it would arrive | Which of the six above |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |
| 6 |  |  |
| 7 |  |  |
| 8 |  |  |
| 9 |  |  |
| 10 |  |  |
